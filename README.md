## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset contains mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars. 

*Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
	*Data analysis shows vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, and AWD provided a non-random amount of variance according to the p-values.

*Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
	*The slope is not zero because of its p-value being 5.31e-11.

*Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
	*The multiple R-squared is about 71% (0.7149); the p-value is below the significance level of 0.05%; therefore, this linear model is effecive.
